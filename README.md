# Weather Forecasting App


## Project Overview
This Weather Forecasting App was developed as part of my internship at Bharat Intern. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and serves as a practical implementation of front-end development concepts, particularly in integrating and utilizing APIs to fetch real-time data.

## Features
API Integration: The app fetches real-time weather data from a public API and displays it to the user.
JavaScript: Handles API requests and dynamically updates the UI with the latest weather information.
Responsive Design: The app is styled using CSS to ensure a consistent and visually appealing experience across different devices.
User-Friendly Interface: The HTML structure is designed to be intuitive and accessible.
